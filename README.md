# bitmask

bitmask is a Dart package for a generic Bitmask class.

Looking in pub.dev, there are two packages that are related to bitmasks:
**enum_flag**, and **surf_util** which contains a Bitmask class. The **enum_flag** package is very barebones, and **surf_util** has been
discontinued.

If I am successful in creating a good generic Bitmask class, I may publish
it as a package, I may simply
leave it here on GitHub, I may roll it into one of my other projects,
or if unsuccessful, I will probably delete this repository. Be warned.

Of course, you are more than welcome to fork this repository, or make contributions to it via pull requests.
